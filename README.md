# Cordova Laboratory

> Caution: Safety Goggles are Recommended!

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is for experimental code. Examples include demo apps,
native api explorations, or anything really that does not fit in an existing Cordova platform.

## Good Karma

Each project should prefix the commits with the project name (or shortered name).
This allows us to easy associate each commit with a project.

For example, the project `./cordova-hello-world`:

    git commit -m "[hello-world] Add an amazing feature."
